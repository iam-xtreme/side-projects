## üìÅ Project Structure

```

note-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # Vite frontend source (index.html, main.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ electron/         # Electron main process scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/             # Built frontend (output of Vite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/            # Build scripts (macOS/Linux)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json       # App config file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ electron-builder.json  # Electron packaging config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/          # Output directory for packaged installers

```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.json` file at the root to define default settings:

```json
{
  "saveIntervalInSeconds": 60,
  "savePath": "/custom/path/to/save/notes"
}
```

During installation, you can specify a custom save path using the installer (on Windows via NSIS or Linux via `.ini`).

## üß± Building the Project

### üî® Prerequisites

* Node.js v18+
* npm
* For Linux: `dpkg`, `fakeroot` (for `.deb`)
* For macOS: Xcode CLI tools
* Electron builder (already included as a dev dependency)

---

### üîß Development (Hot Reload)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs:

* Vite frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
* Electron watching the Vite build

---

### üì¶ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

1. Run `vite build`
2. Package Electron app using `electron-builder`

### üíª Build for macOS or Linux

```bash
# macOS
./build/macos.sh

# Linux
./build/linux.sh
```

Final installers will be placed in the `release/` directory and zipped automatically.

---

## üì¶ Installing the App

After building:

* On macOS: open the `.dmg` file in the `release/` folder
* On Linux: run the `.AppImage` or install the `.deb` package

The app will save notes to your **home directory by default**, unless a custom path is provided during install.

---

## üß≠ Future Scope

* üìÇ Support multiple notes and notebooks
* ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud sync with Dropbox/Google Drive
* üîí End-to-end encrypted notes
* üåì Dark mode toggle
* üîç Full-text search across notes
* üß™ Unit tests and CI for packaging
